# Project Title: Women Rights in Kazakhstan
*This project contains information about women rights in Kazakhstan according to the governmental law. It was focused on a problem that lots of people do not respect women rights, especially in work, household situations where a woman is "below" men. It helped teenagers to start to know about how to not violate women rights.
It was mostly used by youth, but in the future I plan to add more information and cover more broader audience.*
